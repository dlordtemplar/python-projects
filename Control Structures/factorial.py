"""
Implement a Python program that computes the factorial of a given number and
prints the result. (in class, not graded)

The factorial of a number n is defined as follows:

    n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n-1 * n
    
Examples:

    0! = 1
    
    1! = 1
    
    2! = 1 * 2 = 2
    
    3! = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
    
    4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24

number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
